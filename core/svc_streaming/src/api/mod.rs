//! Control-plane REST API surface (`/api/v1/*`).
//!
//! Every handler in this module extracts its own
//! [`crate::http::auth::AuthenticatedClaims`] or
//! [`crate::http::auth::ServiceKey`] directly (rather than relying solely
//! on a `route_layer`) so the router built here is self-contained and
//! testable in isolation via [`router_for_testing`] -- see that function's
//! doc comment. [`router`] and [`internal_router`] are the two production
//! entrypoints [`crate::http::router`] mounts: `router` (community/tenant
//! routes) sits behind the JWT `route_layer`; `internal_router`
//! (`/internal/streaming/*`) does not -- every handler in `internal` already
//! extracts [`crate::http::auth::ServiceKey`] itself, and wrapping it in the
//! JWT layer too (as a single combined nest previously did) defeated the
//! point of a pure service-to-service credential. See `internal`'s module
//! doc for the historical note on that gap, now fixed at the S12
//! integration layer (`src/http/mod.rs`).
//!
//! A `DatabaseConnection` reaches every handler via [`extract::DbConn`]
//! (an `Extension` override if [`router_for_testing`] layered one in,
//! otherwise a lazy [`crate::db::get_or_connect`] singleton) and a
//! [`engine::SharedEngine`] via plain `axum::Extension`, supplied by
//! [`router`]/[`internal_router`]'s caller (the real
//! [`crate::pipeline::FfmpegSupervisor`] in production, a fake in tests).
