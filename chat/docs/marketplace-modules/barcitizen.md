- Track efforts made by coordinators, to allow for data-driven reward systems
- Tight integration with the BarCitizen.org (.sc) website, including an events calendar, giveaway creation and running
- For Attendees: Name, Discord, Email, RSI(?), Reputation
- Facilitate community admin “handshakes” to establish connections between their communities
