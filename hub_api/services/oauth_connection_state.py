"""Single-use OAuth `state` token store for Community Connections (gh-320).

The authorize route (`blueprints/v1/community_connections.py`) mints an
unguessable `state` token and stashes the request context it needs to
finish the flow (which community/provider/user initiated it, the exact
`redirect_uri` sent to the provider, and a PKCE `code_verifier` for
providers that use it) server-side, keyed by that token. The public
callback route later exchanges the `state` query param back for that
context and MUST consume it exactly once -- a state token that could be
replayed would let an attacker who observes/guesses one redirect a
victim's authorization code into the attacker's own community.

Backend: Redis/Valkey (`RATE_LIMITER_CONFIG_KEY`'s existing connection,
reused directly the same way `blueprints/v1/community_music_queue.py`'s
own `_redis_client()` does -- see that function's docstring for why
reaching into `RateLimiter`'s private `_redis` attribute is preferable to
opening a second connection -- falling back to a lazily-opened client
against `HubAPIConfig.valkey_url` for apps that never installed rate
limiting, e.g. most test apps). Redis over the self-contained
AES-GCM-encrypted-token alternative this module could otherwise use
(`services/platform_integrations_crypto.py`'s `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
primitive) because hub-api runs multiple replicas in beta/gamma/prod --
an in-process single-use set would not be visible to whichever pod the
OAuth provider's callback redirect happens to land on, silently breaking
the flow under any replica count above 1. Redis's `GETDEL` (atomic
get-and-delete, Redis/Valkey >=6.2) gives single-use consumption without
a separate DEL round trip or a race between two concurrent callback
requests both reading the same state before either deletes it.

The state token itself (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, ~256 bits of
entropy) is the redis key suffix -- unguessable, so no additional
encryption of the stored payload is needed: the payload never leaves
hub-api's own infra (redis), only the opaque token travels through the
browser/provider redirect chain.
